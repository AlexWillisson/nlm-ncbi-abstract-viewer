The limitations of genotyping technology, the choice of mutations to be tested, and the clinical context in which the test is administered can all influence how genetic information is interpreted. This paper describes the conclusions of a consensus conference to address the use and interpretation of CF mutation analysis in clinical settings. Although the diagnosis of CF is usually straightforward, care needs to be exercised in the use and interpretation of genetic tests: genotype information is not the final arbiter of a clinical diagnosis of CF or CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein related disorders. The diagnosis of these conditions is primarily based on the clinical presentation, and is supported by evaluation of CFTR function (sweat testing, nasal potential difference) and genetic analysis. None of these features are sufficient on their own to make a diagnosis of CF or CFTR-related disorders. Broad genotype/phenotype associations are useful in epidemiological studies, but CFTR genotype does not accurately predict individual outcome. The use of CFTR genotype for prediction of prognosis in people with CF at the time of their diagnosis is not recommended. The importance of communication between clinicians and medical genetic laboratories is emphasized. The results of testing and their implications should be reported in a manner understandable to the clinicians caring for CF patients."}]},{"id":"7683628","title":"Identification of eight novel mutations in a collaborative analysis of a part of the second transmembrane domain of the CFTR gene.","date":"2019-09-04T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"28546993","title":"Nationwide genetic analysis for molecularly unresolved cystic fibrosis patients in a multiethnic society: implications for preconception carrier screening.","date":"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","abstract":[{"body":"Preconception carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) is usually performed using ethnically targeted panels of selected mutations. This has been recently challenged by the use of expanded, ethnically indifferent, pan-population panels.

Few of the almost 2,000 variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene CFTR have empirical evidence that they cause cystic fibrosis. To address this gap, we collected both genotype and phenotype data for 39,696 individuals with cystic fibrosis in registries and clinics in North America and Europe. In these individuals, 159 CFTR variants had an allele frequency of ł0.01%. These variants were evaluated for both clinical severity and functional consequence, with 127 (80%) meeting both clinical and functional criteria consistent with disease. Assessment of disease penetrance in 2,188 fathers of individuals with cystic fibrosis enabled assignment of 12 of the remaining 32 variants as neutral, whereas the other 20 variants remained of indeterminate effect. This study illustrates that sourcing data directly from well-phenotyped subjects can address the gap in our ability to interpret clinically relevant genomic variation.

Extended CFTR mutation screening was performed in 310 infertile men (25 with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD), 116 with non-CAVD azoospermia, 169 with severe oligospermia), 70 female partners and 96 healthy controls. CFTR mutations were detected in the majority (68%) of CAVD patients and in significant proportions in azoospermic (31%) and oligospermic (22%) men. Carrier frequency among partners of infertile men was 16/70, exceeding that of controls (6/96) significantly (P = 0.0005). Thus, in 23% of infertile couples both partners were carriers, increasing the risk for their offspring to inherit two mutations to 25% or 50%. This study emphasizes the necessity to offer extended CFTR mutation screening and counselling not only to patients with CAVD but also to azoospermic and oligozoospermic men and their partners before undergoing assisted reproduction techniques. The identification of rare and/or mild mutations will not be a reason to abstain from parenthood, but will allow adequate treatment in children at risk for atypical or mild cystic fibrosis as soon as they develop any symptoms."}]},{"id":"22658665","title":"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations in pancreatitis.","date":"2013-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","abstract":[{"body":"The pancreas is one of the primary organs affected by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. While exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a well-recognized complication of cystic fibrosis (CF), symptomatic pancreatitis is often under-recognized.","label":"background"},{"body":"The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of CFTR mutation-associated pancreatitis, which affects patients with pancreatic sufficient CF, CFTR-related pancreatitis, and idiopathic pancreatitis. The current hypothesis regarding the role of CFTR dysfunction in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, and concepts on genotype-phenotype correlations between CFTR and symptomatic pancreatitis will be reviewed. Symptomatic pancreatitis occurs in 20% of pancreatic sufficient CF patients. In order to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations, the Pancreatic Insufficiency Prevalence (PIP) score was developed and validated to determine severity in a large number of CFTR mutations. Specific CFTR genotypes are significantly associated with pancreatitis. Patients who carry genotypes with mild phenotypic effects have a greater risk of developing pancreatitis than patients carrying genotypes with moderate-severe phenotypic consequences at any given time.","label":"results"},{"body":"The genotype-phenotype correlation in pancreatitis is unique compared to other organ manifestations but still consistent with the complex monogenic nature of CF. Paradoxically, genotypes associated with otherwise mild phenotypic effects have a greater risk for causing pancreatitis; compared with genotypes associated with moderate to severe disease phenotypes. Greater understanding into the underlying mechanisms of disease is much needed. The emergence of CFTR-assist therapies may potentially play a future role in the treatment of CFTR-mutation associated pancreatitis.","label":"conclusions"}]},{"id":"23891399","title":"Effect of ivacaftor on CFTR forms with missense mutations associated with defects in protein processing or function.","date":"2016-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","abstract":[{"body":"Ivacaftor (KALYDECO™, VX-770) is a CFTR potentiator that increased CFTR channel activity and improved lung function in patients age 6 years and older with CF who have the G551D-CFTR gating mutation.

We analyzed deidentified ES data from 6,517 participants (2,204 African Americans and 4,313 European Americans) from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project. We characterized the frequencies of pathogenic alleles in genes underlying Mendelian conditions commonly assessed by newborn-screening (NBS, n = 39) programs, genes associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD, n = 17), and genes known to influence drug response (PGx, n = 14). From these 70 genes, we identified 10,789 variants and curated them by manual review of OMIM, HGMD, locus-specific databases, or primary literature to a total of 399 validated pathogenic variants. The mean number of risk alleles per individual was 15.3. Every individual had at least five known PGx alleles, 99% of individuals had at least one ARMD risk allele, and 45% of individuals were carriers for at least one pathogenic NBS allele. The carrier burden for severe recessive childhood disorders was 0.57. Our results demonstrate that risk alleles of potential clinical utility for both Mendelian and complex traits are detectable in every individual. These findings highlight the necessity of developing guidelines and policies that consider the return of results to all individuals and underscore the need to develop innovative approaches and tools that enable individuals to exercise their choice about the return of incidental results.
